ULarn as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License.
A copy of the GPL should be included in the distribution.

Some source files used in the program are not GPL.

This version is based loosely on ULarn 1.5pl4, but the changes it has
undergone have been so substantial that identifying changes to the original
version is now meaningless. Basically, almost everything has changed in some
way.
